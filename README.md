# VanillaPSX by DRON12261

# STATUS: âœ…RELEASED

**VanillaPSX** is an audio-visual mod for near-vanilla ports that brings the Doom PSX aesthetic to PC Doom as much as possible.

The mod replaces all sprites, sounds (95% in high quality, thanks to Doom 64 Remastered), menu and interface graphics.

There is an additional addon that replaces the game's palette with one that is closer to Doom PSX, but it is not recommended to include it together with WAD, which contain their own palette.

The mod does not contain DEHACKED files, which means it does not affect gameplay or balance and will not conflict in any way with other WADs that may contain their own DEHACKED file.

The mod is compatible with most ports except Chocolate Doom and DOS. At a minimum the following ports have been tested by me:
- DSDA
- prBoom+
- ZDoom
- GZDoom
- Doom Retro
- Woof!
- Nugget Doom
- Cherry Doom
- Rude Doom
- Eternity Engine
- etc.

If you need assets to create a Doom PSX-inspired map, feel free to use VanillaPSX and include it in your wad/pk3/pke, making sure to specify credits beforehand.
